# simple-stitcher
Stitches image tiles together that have been acquired using [MicroManager](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Micro-Manager) multidimensional acquisition.

# Requirements
Install requirements by creating a conda environment:

```
conda create --name <env> --file conda_requirements.txt
```
Afterwards, install addditional pacakages with pip (after you've [activated](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) the conda environment)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
The .pos file generated by MicroManager should be in the same folder as the images that you want to stitch. The `Stitcher` object expects the filepath of the .pos file during initialisation.

```python
# Specify file location
filepath = 'path/to/PositionList.pos'

# Create Stitcher object
s = Stitcher(position_list_filename)

# Stitch and save
s.stitch()
s.save('stitched.png') 
```

This will save the stitched image in the same directory as the original images.

# To do
As of now, overlap between tile images is not accounted for.
